          <p class="lead">
            The schools also welcome transfers from other schools.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            According to Prof. David Iornem, New Idea Commonwealth Education Group is "doing this to make sure that all children who are out of school because of financial difficulties will go back to school without any hindrance."
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            TNT understands that the New Idea Commonwealth Education Group has over 100 graduate teachers and charges fees lower than any school in Gboko, Zaki Biam, or any of our locations.
          </p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p class="mb-0">"Our goal is to deliver quality education to all our students, so they are knowledgeable, self-confident, and educationally mature as they leave Secondary School. Our students are not interested in examination malpractice that miracle centres conduct," the New Idea Commonwealth Education Group President told TNT.</p>
